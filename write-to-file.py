# This file contains code to learn how to write data to a file using python
# This is also known as storing data in flat files
# The type of files can be .csv, .json or even .txt
# Other ways to store data is to store data inside a database


# For now we are focusing on storing data in files

# To read from/write to a file in Python first we have to open it using the in-built open() function
# Never forget to close the file, else it will stay in the memory(RAM)
